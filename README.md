# Brainstroke_prediction
 Brain Stroke Occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts.Without the blood supply, the brain cells gradually die, and disability occurs depending on the area of the brain affected. A  stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.
 We used machine learning algorithms decision tree,random forest,Logistic Regression  Algorithms to train the model to predict the Whether there is a chance of  brainstroke or not.We got Highest accuracy with Random Forest Model
The dataset contains columns:'gender', 'age', 'hypertension', 'heart_disease', 'ever_married', 'work_type', 'Residence_type', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi','smoking_status', 'stroke'
As per the data people who have hypertension and got heart attack are more prone to Stroke
