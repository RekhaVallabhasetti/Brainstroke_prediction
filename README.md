# Brainstroke_prediction
 Brain Stroke Occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts.Without the blood supply, the brain cells gradually die, and disability occurs depending on the area of the brain affected. A  stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.
 We used machine learning algorithms decision tree,random forest,Logistic Regression  Algorithms to train the model to predict the Whether there is a chance of  brainstroke or not.We got Highest accuracy with Random Forest Model
